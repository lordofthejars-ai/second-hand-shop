= Second Hand Shop

Modified version of https://github.com/azure-Samples/java-ai.

It is a simplified version keeping similar functions but:

* Monolith to simplify deployment for demo
* Quarkus to fast start time, dev services for DB
* Quarkus LangChain4J for easy integration with LangChain4J and Quarkus, and extra features like Guard Rails
* Qute for Server Side frontend rendering to make it easy for backend developers

To start the example you need to:

* Set `QUARKUS_LANGCHAIN4J_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API Key.
* Have Docker or Podman Desktop installed in your computer in order to Quarkus automatically start PostgreSQL database.
* Run `./mvnw quarkus:dev`
